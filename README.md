Implementing GTFS for the Brazos Transit District Bryan/College Station system

I'm using [GitHub - WRI-Cities/static-GTFS-manager: GUI interface for creating, editing, exporting of static GTFS data for a public transit authority](https://github.com/WRI-Cities/static-GTFS-manager)
for managing and editing the GTFS data and  [GitHub - google/transitfeed: A Python library for reading, validating, and writing transit schedule information in the GTFS format.](https://github.com/google/transitfeed) for validating via Travis CI.

oh. hello. apparently http://www.ridebtd.org/ exists. maybe i can pull the feed from there
